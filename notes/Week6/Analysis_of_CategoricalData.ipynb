    "# Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Chi-Square Goodness of Fit test is used to determine whether the distribution of categorical data fits a specified distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis (H0): The observed frequencies match the expected frequencies.\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference between observed and expected frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formula\n",
    "\\[ \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{{(O_i - E_i)^2}}{{E_i}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "Suppose you roll a fair six-sided die 60 times and want to test if the outcomes follow an equal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observed Frequencies\n",
    "- 1: 12 times\n",
    "- 2: 10 times\n",
    "- 3: 8 times\n",
    "- 4: 15 times\n",
    "- 5: 9 times\n",
    "- 6: 6 times\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Frequencies (for a fair die)\n",
    "- 1: 10 times\n",
    "- 2: 10 times\n",
    "- 3: 10 times\n",
    "- 4: 10 times\n",
    "- 5: 10 times\n",
    "- 6: 10 times\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import scipy.stats as stats\n",
    "\n",
    "observed = [12, 10, 8, 15, 9, 6]\n",
    "expected = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "chi2_stat, p_value = stats.chisquare(f_obs=observed, f_exp=expected)\n",
