    "## Simulation Methods: Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Monte Carlo simulation uses random sampling to model real-world processes or solve mathematical problems.\n",
    "- **Purpose:** It helps predict outcomes and estimate probabilities by running computer simulations.\n",
    "- **Example:** Simulating the outcomes of tossing a coin multiple times to estimate the probability of getting heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling Technique: Bootstrap Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:** The Bootstrap method generates numerous \"pseudo\" samples from observed data.\n",
    "- **Objective:** Estimates uncertainty, constructs confidence intervals, and assesses accuracy without relying on strong assumptions.\n",
    "- **Example:** Creating multiple resamples from a dataset to estimate the uncertainty of the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computer Simulations for Statistical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Using computers to create simulated data to explore statistical questions or test hypotheses.\n",
    "- **Application:** Enables experimentation with different scenarios and complex models that might be challenging to solve analytically.\n",
    "- **Example:** Simulating the performance of different investment portfolios to assess risk and return.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimating Using Law of Large Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept:** The Law of Large Numbers states that as sample size increases, sample statistics approach population parameters.\n",
    "- **Usage:** Utilized to estimate population parameters by examining larger samples.\n",
    "- **Example:** Estimating the average number of defective products in a factory by examining a substantial sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plug-in Principle in Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idea:** Substitute sample estimates into statistical formulas for unknown population parameters.\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Simplifies calculations and allows estimation without precise population parameter knowledge.\n",
    "- **Example:** Using the sample mean to estimate the population mean in statistical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parametric Bootstrap and Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parametric Bootstrap:** Creating bootstrap samples based on specific parametric assumptions.\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals:** Deriving confidence intervals using resampling techniques.\n",
    "- **Illustration:** Estimating the confidence interval for the mean difference between two groups with parametric bootstrapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bootstrapping in Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Application:** Employing bootstrapping in regression to assess model stability, estimate uncertainties, and derive reliable estimates.\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Useful for complex regression models where traditional assumptions might not hold.\n",
    "- **Example:** Bootstrapping to determine the uncertainty of coefficients in a non-linear regression model.\n",
