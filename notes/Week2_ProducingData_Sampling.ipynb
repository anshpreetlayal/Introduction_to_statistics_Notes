    "# Statistical Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:**\n",
    "  - Statistical inference is the process of making conclusions or predictions about a population based on sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Process:**\n",
    "  - Involves using sample statistics to estimate population parameters or to test hypotheses about the population.\n",
    "  - Enables generalization of findings from a sample to the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Types:**\n",
    "  - *Estimation:* Involves estimating population parameters (e.g., mean, proportion) based on sample statistics.\n",
    "  - *Hypothesis Testing:* Determines the significance of observed effects or differences in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applications:**\n",
    "  - Widely used in scientific research, economics, healthcare, and various fields to draw meaningful conclusions from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simple Random Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:**\n",
    "  - Simple random sampling is a sampling technique where each individual in the population has an equal probability of being chosen for the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Process:**\n",
    "  - Randomly selects individuals from the population without any specific pattern or criteria.\n",
    "  - Ensures each member of the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - Easy to implement and understand.\n",
    "  - Reduces selection bias and ensures representativeness of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stratified Random Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:**\n",
    "  - Stratified random sampling involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Process:**\n",
    "  - Ensures representation of different subgroups within the population.\n",
    "  - Samples are proportionately selected from each stratum to create a more representative sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - Useful when the population contains diverse groups or variations.\n",
    "  - Provides more precise estimates for each subgroup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bias and Chance Error\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias:**\n",
    "  - Bias refers to systematic errors that consistently skew results in a specific direction, causing inaccurate conclusions.\n",
    "  - Results from flaws in study design, data collection, or analysis methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chance Error (Random Error):**\n",
    "  - Chance error refers to random fluctuations or variability in sample data that occur by chance.\n",
    "  - Not consistent and tends to cancel out over multiple samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relation:**\n",
    "  - Minimizing bias improves the accuracy and validity of results, while chance error can be reduced by increasing sample size or conducting multiple samples.\n",
