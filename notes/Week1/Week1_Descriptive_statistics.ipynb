    "    - Provides a quick indicator of the spread of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variance:**\n",
    "  - *Definition:* Variance measures the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n",
    "  - *Calculation:* Involves squaring the differences between each data point and the mean, summing these squared differences, and then dividing by the number of observations.\n",
    "  - *Usefulness:*\n",
    "    - Quantifies the spread or dispersion of data points around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation:**\n",
    "  - *Definition:* The standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset.\n",
    "  - *Calculation:* It is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "  - *Usefulness:*\n",
    "    - Offers a measure of the average distance of data points from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Descriptive Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Percentiles:**\n",
    "  - *Definition:* Percentiles divide a dataset into hundredths, indicating the position of a value within the dataset relative to others.\n",
    "  - *Usefulness:*\n",
    "    - Helps understand the relative standing of a particular value within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quartiles:**\n",
    "  - *Definition:* Quartiles divide a dataset into quarters, specifically the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles.\n",
    "  - *Usefulness:*\n",
    "    - Provide insights into the spread of data and identify the central tendencies at different levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures and metrics in descriptive statistics offer various ways to summarize and interpret datasets, providing insights into their central tendencies, variability, and distributions. They are essential tools for understanding and analyzing data in diverse fields of study.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pie Chart\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:**\n",
    "  - A circular statistical graphic representing parts of a whole.\n",
    "  - Each slice represents a proportion of the total, typically expressed as percentages.\n",
    "  - Commonly used to visualize categorical data distributions and their relative sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dot Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:**\n",
    "  - A visual representation of data points along a number line.\n",
    "  - Each dot represents an individual data point.\n",
    "  - Useful for displaying the distribution of values, showing the frequency or clustering of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bar Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:**\n",
    "  - Uses bars to represent categories or groups of categorical data.\n",
    "  - The length or height of each bar corresponds to the frequency, count, or proportion of each category.\n",
    "  - Ideal for comparing discrete categories or groups visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Box-and-Whisker Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:**\n",
    "  - Presents the distribution of a dataset using five summary statistics: minimum, maximum, median, first quartile (Q1), and third quartile (Q3).\n",
    "  - Displays outliers and variability in data.\n",
    "  - Useful for identifying central tendencies, variability, and detecting outliers in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scatterplot\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:**\n",
    "  - A graphical representation showing the relationship between two continuous variables.\n",

    "  - Helpful in identifying correlations, trends, or patterns between variables and detecting outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:**\n",
    "  - The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset.\n",
    "  - It quantifies the extent of spread or dispersion of data points around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculation:**\n",
    "  - The standard deviation is calculated as the square root of the variance.\n",
    "  - Variance is computed by taking the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Formula:**\n",
    "  - Standard Deviation (σ) = √Variance\n",
    "  - Variance (σ²) = Σ(xᵢ - μ)² / N\n",
    "    - Where xᵢ is each individual data point,\n",
    "    - μ (mu) is the mean of the dataset,\n",
    "    - N is the total number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretation:**\n",
    "  - Larger standard deviation implies higher variability or dispersion of data points from the mean.\n",
    "  - Smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be closer to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Properties:**\n",
    "  - Provides a single value that represents the average distance of data points from the mean.\n",
    "  - Sensitive to outliers: Outliers can significantly impact the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usefulness:**\n",
    "  - Offers insight into the spread or diversity within a dataset.\n",
    "  - Helps in assessing the consistency or variability of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relation to Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "  - In a normal distribution, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and approximately 99.7% within three standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applications:**\n",
    "  - Widely used in various fields such as finance, sciences, social sciences, and quality control to measure variability and assess data reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is a crucial statistical tool used to understand the dispersion of data points around the mean, providing valuable insights into the variability of datasets across different fields of study.\n",
