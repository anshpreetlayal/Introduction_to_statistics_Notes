    "- **Description:**\n",
    "  - **Measures of Central Tendency:**\n",
    "    - *Mean:* The average value of a dataset calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of observations. It's sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "    - *Median:* The middle value when the data is arranged in ascending order. It's less affected by extreme values.\n",
    "    - *Mode:* The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.\n",
    "  - **Measures of Variability:**\n",
    "    - *Range:* The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "    - *Variance:* The average of the squared differences from the mean. It measures the spread of data points.\n",
    "    - *Standard Deviation:* A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset.\n",
    "  - **Other Descriptive Metrics:**\n",
    "    - *Percentiles:* Divide a dataset into hundredths, indicating the position of a value within the dataset.\n",
    "    - *Quartiles:* Divide a dataset into quarters (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles).\n",

    "## Pie Chart\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:**\n",
    "  - A circular statistical graphic representing parts of a whole.\n",
    "  - Each slice represents a proportion of the total, typically expressed as percentages.\n",
    "  - Commonly used to visualize categorical data distributions and their relative sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dot Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:**\n",
    "  - A visual representation of data points along a number line.\n",
    "  - Each dot represents an individual data point.\n",
    "  - Useful for displaying the distribution of values, showing the frequency or clustering of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bar Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:**\n",
    "  - Uses bars to represent categories or groups of categorical data.\n",
    "  - The length or height of each bar corresponds to the frequency, count, or proportion of each category.\n",
    "  - Ideal for comparing discrete categories or groups visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Box-and-Whisker Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:**\n",
    "  - Presents the distribution of a dataset using five summary statistics: minimum, maximum, median, first quartile (Q1), and third quartile (Q3).\n",
    "  - Displays outliers and variability in data.\n",
    "  - Useful for identifying central tendencies, variability, and detecting outliers in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scatterplot\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description:**\n",
    "  - A graphical representation showing the relationship between two continuous variables.\n",
    "  - Each point on the plot represents a pair of values from the dataset.\n",
    "  - Helpful in identifying correlations, trends, or patterns between variables and detecting outliers.\n",
